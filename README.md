DFWS_Simulator is a class that contains all tools necessary to simulate a deconvolution from wavefront sensing adaptive optics system. 
DFWS_Solver contains tools to extract information from the images generated by DFWS_Simulator, all contained in the DFWS class

DFWS_Simulation is an example of how to interact with the simulator and solver files.

Software is in early development, detailed readme will follow.
